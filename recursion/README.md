###### Types of Recursion

1. Tail Recursion
2. Head Recursion
3. Tree Recursion
4. Indirect Recursion
5. Nested Recursion

Recursion is an algorithmic approach of solving problem by calling itself. This can be a very powerful tool in writing algorhtims however, it requires precise understanding as space & time complexity is also very high.
